# Cursor Rule: auth

## Applies to
components/auth/**/*, hooks/use-customer.ts, framework/*/auth/**/*

## Description
Guidelines for authentication and customer session logic.

## Rules
- Use `useCustomer` to manage logged-in state.
- Protect routes with `withAuth` HOC or redirect pattern.
- Avoid storing auth tokens in localStorage â€” use secure cookies.
- Hook-based auth logic must be framework-agnostic.
