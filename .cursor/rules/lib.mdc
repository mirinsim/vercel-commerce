# Cursor Rule: lib

## Applies to
lib/**/*

## Description
Rules for helper functions, fetchers, and utilities.

## Rules
- Shared utilities must not depend on UI libraries.
- `lib/fetcher.ts` should be generic and reused across the app.
- Use TypeScript for type-safety in all helpers.
- Organize by function (e.g., `utils/`, `validators/`, `api/`).
