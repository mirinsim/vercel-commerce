# Cursor Rule: types

## Applies to
types/**/*

## Description
Type system guidelines for shared models and interfaces.

## Rules
- Types must be colocated with provider or feature if not used globally.
- Avoid type duplication across features.
- Use `export type` not `interface` unless extending.
- Suffix custom types with `Type` (e.g., `ProductType`).
