# Cursor Rule: tailwind

## Applies to
components/**/*

## Description
Rules for using Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Rules
- Use spacing scale consistently (`px-4`, `mt-2`, etc).
- Prefer utility classes over custom CSS.
- Use `@apply` sparingly â€” only in reusable CSS components.
- Keep Tailwind classes ordered: layout > spacing > color > state.
