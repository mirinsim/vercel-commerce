# Cursor Rule: pages

## Applies to
pages/**/*.{ts,tsx}

## Description
Rules for Next.js page components in Vercel Commerce.

## Rules
- Use `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` where possible to leverage ISR/SSG.
- Page-level components must handle loading and error states gracefully.
- Import layout components from `@components` rather than redefining them.
- Avoid hardcoded SEO metadata; use centralized SEO configuration.
- All routes must be typed with Next.js `NextPage` type.
