# Cursor Rule: config

## Applies to

## Description
Guidelines for global configuration files and environment variables.

## Rules
- All feature flags and environment settings must be centralized.
- Do not access `process.env` outside `config` or `next.config.js`.
- Config must be type-safe and consistent across environments.
