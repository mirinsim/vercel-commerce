# Cursor Rule: components

## Applies to
components/**/*.{ts,tsx}

## Description
Rules for UI components, styling, and best practices.

## Rules
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Avoid inline styles.
- Use `classnames` for conditional styles.
- Prefer functional components with `FC<Props>` typing.
- Break down large components into smaller reusable parts.
- Maintain accessibility: label form elements, use semantic HTML, `aria-*` attributes.
- Group reusable UI elements in `components/ui` when possible.
