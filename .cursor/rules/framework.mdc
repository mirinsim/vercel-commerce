# Cursor Rule: framework

## Applies to
framework/**/*

## Description
Guidelines for multi-provider eCommerce backend logic.

## Rules
- Each provider (e.g., BigCommerce, Shopify) must be in a separate subdirectory.
- Do not mix logic between providers.
- Interfaces must be standardized and provider-agnostic.
- Avoid hardcoding business logic into the provider layer.
- Keep shared provider types in `framework/common`.
