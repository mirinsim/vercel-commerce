# Cursor Rule: tests

## Applies to
tests/**/*, __tests__/**/*

## Description
Testing standards for unit and integration tests.

## Rules
- Use `@testing-library/react` for UI tests.
- Snapshot tests should be minimal and purpose-driven.
- Organize test files next to the code or under `__tests__`.
- Mocks must be reset between tests.
- Prefer descriptive test names using `it('should...')` syntax.
